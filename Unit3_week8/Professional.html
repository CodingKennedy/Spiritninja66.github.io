		<p> My friends have been reviewing and criticizing my blogs as the weeks of phase 0 has passed by. I have been playing around a bit with designs and trying to make them better. I am trying to create a blog similar to the feel of tumblr. I have been changing my designs and trying to make it responsive. I have learned a lot about from css and html. I have used Google chrome to look at others codes and try and figure out how to make my website more efficient. I feel it has come a long way. Each blog I try to add or change something within it. I feel with each step that I am getting closer to making it more professional. I need to work on a few more things, but I am happy with what I have learned and what I have implemented.</p>
