		<p> "I have been excited for DBC since before the initial interview. These past 8 weeks have been tough. Before this year, I have had no experience in programming at all. I was nervous and excited about starting to learn something new. After watching the video “Kitchen vs. Table”, I feel a bit more confident in myself. I felt that maybe I am learning slowly or that maybe I am not learning at all. I worry about starting the actual DBC because a lot of people I have paired with seem to know a lot more about programing than I do. They think differently and might be better equipped with a mind set for programming than myself. "</p>
		<p> "I knew from the beginning that this would be a different type of learning experience. I spent 5.5 years in college for psychology and felt like I wasted my time and was pulled around on a string with no real world use. These last 8 weeks have felt real. I know I am being trained to think and understand like a programmer. I am learning on my own and I have learned more than I ever have before. I feel like I am actually headed in a direction towards something and I am excited. DBC is a lot of self-learning but I know I am not alone. We have done a ton of guided pair programming. I have gotten to know a few of my peers a lot better and I have a good sense of everyone’s level. I have been able to help people with my current level and I have been able to learn a lot from those who are a higher level than myself. I am somewhat of an introvert so I thought this might be challenging, but the more comfortable I get with people, the easier it has been for me to talk to people from my cohort. I enjoy expressing my thoughts and talking my problems out loud now. It has helped me figure out some of the problems I had faced."</p>
