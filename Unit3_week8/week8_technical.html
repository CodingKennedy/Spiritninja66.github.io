		<p> "What is the Internet? Mostly magic? Useless Muggle technology? Maybe both! Or so it may seem."</p>
		<p> "It is actually wire that is buried in the ground…so useless muggle technology. But that wire is made up of different materials of fiber optics, copper, maybe satellites, and cellphone towers play a roll in it as well. "</p>
		<p> "Two computers attached to this wire will allow them both to communicate. A server is known as a computer that is connected directly to the Internet. Web pages are files on that computers hard drive. So some magic may be involved, just needs a bit of magic. "</p>
		<p> "Each of the computers has a special ip address, which would work like your house address. The number on your house helps you find where you live…especially if you have a short memory span. Google.com, Tumblr.com, Facebook.com: They are all names associated with the ip address so that you are able to find it easier that typing in 72.14.205.100 to find the Google website. "</p>
		<p> "Your computer at home is not a server. It is not connected directly to the Internet. Computers used by regular consumers are known as clients. We are connected indirectly to the Internet through an ISP “Internet Service Provider”. So for you to use the internet, you have to use your computer whose internet is provided by “Time Warner”, “Verizon”, or some other provider. From there you are placed onto the Internet where you will type in Google.com and connect with Google’s server to view their content. "</p>
		<p> "Emails? Same stems as before, and now you compose your email. When you are all set, you press send! And your email flies from the gmail server onto the Internet and to the server of the person you are emailing: ie Aol, yahoo, Hotmail, etc. "</p>
