<strong>Abstract Random</strong> is defined as: “organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.” Just reviewing this tells me that I have a ton of issues with coding. Coding so far has been very structured. Stories, pseudocode, initial code, refactored code, and driver code: This is the order we are supposed to work in and I have been having a ton of trouble following the order. Normally I see a problem and I just want to dive into it. As I am diving in I will stop where is needed and then pseudocode. I guess some will define it as random, but for me it is the order that I have known. There have been many times that pseudocodeing first would have helped me out 100% more that diving in randomly. 
<strong> Abstract Sequental</strong> is defined as “love the world of theory and abstract thought.” I am supposedly equal in this style as well, but I feel that I lean closer to Abstract random. I do like logic a lot though and theory. 

I wonder how I can use these styles to my advantage. Thought, I love to think. I feel if I took more time to just think things through, I would be better that getting pseudocode done in the beginning. I also need to ask more questions especially when I feel stumped. I need resources at the tip of my fingers to refer to as well as other codes to draw ideas from, or maybe that is what is hindering me. 

These last 4 months have been the most coding I have ever seen. Everything is really new to me and I feel that my inexperience leads me into walls. I forget how much I don’t know and continue to barrel through problems. Diving into things without knowing what I am doing will make things really difficult. I need to visualize and theorize a bit more before coding.
