		<p> "What is computer memory? Computer memory is knows as RAM. RAM is random access memory. It holds the information that the computer is working on. RAM is different from the computers hard drive. Information is stored in the hard drive, but RAM is faster than the hard drive and accesses the memory needed at the right moment and time. When you turn your computer on, the ram will read from the hard drive and load the operating system. When you click on programs or applications, the RAM will then read that information from the hard drive. This allows the computer to run faster. The more memory your computer has, the more programs can be opened and ran at once. Ram is measured in speeds known as Megahertz or MHz."</p>
