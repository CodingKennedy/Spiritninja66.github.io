		<tr><td>Just from reading that sentence my mind rushes with an image I stumbled across the Internet the other day. It was a picture of most of the satellites that surround the earth. There are over 2,000 satellites that orbit the earth. Some don’t even work anymore. The U.S. and Russia own most of them. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>The image terrified me at what humans have done to all of the earth and the space around the earth. Thanks to smart phones and easier access to computers, everyone is constantly wired into Internet and connected with each other. But I also see people becoming complete zombies. Our attention is warped and we have almost no focus on anything anymore. There are a lot of problems I see, but maybe they aren’t problems? </tr></td>

		<tr><td>I am a writer before I am anything else. My mind naturally gravitates to fantasy and sci-fi. So naturally I identify two problems with the modern-day, tech junk, and the need to continuously be attached. I originally saw it as a problem but then I think to Darwin’s theory of evolution and wonder what might happen next? </tr></td>
		<tr><td>Technology is evolving and it has been evolving for a while now. The smartphones you have in your pocket are so much more powerful that the computers used to put the first humans on the moon. Your phones are more powerful than that!!! Can you imagine the capabilities it can really have? But let me not stray way from the topic.

		<tr><td>I am focusing on tech junk for now. The skies are cluttered with it. Our streets are cluttered with it, and over all it is giving out negative emissions and damaging the planet. What about if they weren’t just junk? What if our tech evolved into biological tech? I recently saw an experiment in which plants were fused with nano-technology to absorb more sunlight than it could before. This first started as an experiment to turn plants into solar cells, but they were able to integrate the technology for a different function. What if all of the plants became the new tech? bioluminescent plants to light the street, maybe even trees with free wifi? Maybe I might be jumping to much into scifi on this one, but anything is possible. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>Now for the zombies: You know them, you have seen them, you might be one of them. Constantly on your phone looking up random stuff on google. Jamming to music on the train, maybe even reading Game of Thrones on your tablet. We want to be connected. We are addicted to the internet and all that it knows. What if all of that information was attached to our brains? What if we were connected to the web all of the time? Would we live in a matrix styled world where we could just download everything we needed to know? I am reaching for biotech again, but this time with humans. </tr></td>

	Have you heard of the theory of singularity before? It is basically what I described before. Minds constantly connected and attached. The idea one oneness with the universe becoming a reality. Might sound crazy, but technically we are already headed in that diection. Our smartphones, computers and technologies have become mediums. These mediums have turned us into cyborgs. We are attached to our technology. Only time may tell where we are really headed with all of this?
