		<tr><td>In ruby, everything is an object. A class can then be defined as a design where individual objects are then born. When we create a class, we have to think about what the object will contain and what it will do. What the class contains, or what the class knows, are instance variables. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>To understand why classes are needed, we must understand what an object is. In our programs, objects are supposed to work for us. We can ask them for information. We can assign tasks that need to be completed. We tell them what to process and what to report back to us. Classes are needed to construct objects. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>Classes are often used to model real-world objects. An example would be to create a class called <q>dog</q></tr></td>
		<tr><td>Class dog</tr></td>
		<tr><td>From there we would define the dog by breed or type, age, where it lives.</tr></td>
		<tr><td>def breed(siberian_husky)</tr></td>
		<tr><td>@siberian_husky= siberian_husky</tr></td>
		<tr><td>end</tr></td>
		<tr><td>def age(years_old)</tr></td>
		<tr><td>@years_old= years_old</tr></td>
		<tr><td>years_old=9</tr></td>
		<tr><td>puts  <q>#{@siberian_husky} is #{@years_old} years old.</q></tr></td>
		<tr><td>end</tr></td>
		<tr><td>end</tr></td>
		<tr><td> =><q>Siberian_husky is 9 years old.</q></tr></td>
		<tr><td>Instance Variables are what I used above with the @ symbol. The @siberian_husky belongs to the Class dog. Outside of this class it will not work the same. It cannot be shared with other classes. </tr></td>
