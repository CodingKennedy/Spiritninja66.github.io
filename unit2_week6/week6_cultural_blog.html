		<tr><td>I don’t want to use any specific examples of stereotype threat so I will remain pretty vague on this one. This threat revolves around a negative opinion on a certain group and it is implied that this characteristic is carried out on the same types of the people from that group. We have all heard it at one point or time. People judge you based on how you look and compare you to others that look or act similar and then give you their own self-fulfilling prophecy before they even get to know you. It isn’t right and those of a lower intellect in my opinion use it. Those with more open-minded points of view see things differently. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>My plan when I feel this or see others feeling stereotype-threat? I try not to let things bother me. If people want to be stupid, I don’t typically waste my time on them. If it were someone else though, I would talk to them and the aggressors. It is always up to the individual though to fight their battles and choose which side of them they would want to show. You always have to be yourself and be confidant in who you are. </tr></td>
		<tr><td>“Be the change you want to see in the world” I feel these words are important for any situations. You have to live the morals you live by, not just for yourself but for those around you. Everything you do changes people around you ever so slightly. Laughter is always the best cure, and those who can laugh together can be friends. Those are some of the rules I live by, what is more welcoming than people who can laugh together?</tr></td>
