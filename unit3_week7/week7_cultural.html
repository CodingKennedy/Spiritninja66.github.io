		<tr><td>I mentioned it before; I have dealt with stereo type a lot in school and work. I looked back at my values blog and try to think of a way to combat it. I have learned that my perception of the world is a thought within my own mine. I am in control of my own thoughts and can analyze them and understand them. If some one wants to create a stereotype of me, or try to guess who I am, that is their own problem. I donâ€™t care what other people think or say about me. It is their loss if they are so closed-minded. I am here for a reason, to learn. 
	I am also hoping that my own personality type would sway someone from making judgments about me before hand. Many of my coworkers stereotyped me based on how I looked in the past. They more they got to know me, the more I was able to establish the face I want them to see me with.
	Creativity is something I hold dearest to me. I said it was like a superpower of mine. I would use this as my way to combat stereotype
