		<tr><td>SQL injection is a code injection technique that attacks data driven applications. These injections exploit security vulnerability in the software. 
How to defend against SQL injections?
1-prepared statements: These will ensure that attackers canâ€™t change the intent of the query. We do this by defining the SQLcode. 
2- Stored procedures: This is similar to prepared statements, the differences is that the procedures is stored within the database itself.
3-Escaping all user supplied input: This one is a last resort and should be tried with caution. 

I have read that NoSQL databases are starting to become popular now. They seem to be somewhat similar to SQL databases but I am curious more in NoSQL.
