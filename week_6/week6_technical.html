		<tr><td><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>- As I have learned, object oriented programming is exactly like it sounds, but complicated. What is an object? A bottle of water is an object. A plastic bottle is an object, and water is also an object. Each of those objects are different and do different things. The plastic bottle is created as a container for something liquid. The water is then an object that is defined with different methods that make it a liquid but can be contained by a container. That is basically object oriented programming. You define the object, and then attribute methods to it to manipulate it like my bottle and water example. You can make an organized address book, and then a method to add a new name and contact information. </tr></td>
		<tr><td><strong>Functional programming</strong>- FP is similar to OOP but it cannot be manipulated after it is created. In object oriented programming, I would be able to change the water content in the bottle to captain morgan, and I would be able to turn the plastic bottle into a glass with ice. FP allows you to build but it treats all of its input as mathematical evaluation.</tr></td>
